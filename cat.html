The nesting syntax is used to create a parent-child relationship between the CSS selectors.

For example, if I call myFirstMixin with the arguments #ff0000, 24px, and 2px, it will generate the following CSS rule: .myFirstMixin { background-color: #ff0000; font-size: 24px; border-width: 2px; }.</td>

          <td class="timeremaining cell c1 lastcol" style="">The main difference between SASS and CSS is that SASS is a preprocessor language that extends CSS with more features and functions. SASS is compiled into CSS before it is interpreted by the browser. SASS is more powerful and flexible than CSS. SASS allows for nesting, variables, conditionals, functions, and loops. SASS is also more concise than CSS. SASS is used in the project to style the pages. For example, the colors of the navigation bar are set in the SASS file. The SASS file is compiled into CSS before it is interpreted by the browser.</td>

            The two branches created in the project are the "dev" branch and the "test" branch. The "dev" branch is used for development and the "test" branch is used for testing. The branches were created using the "git branch" command. To switch to one of the branches, the "git checkout" command is used. For example, "git checkout dev" will switch to the "dev" branch.

          <td class="timeremaining cell c1 lastcol" style="">A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It's a way to handle asynchronous code in a more structured and manageable way.A Promise is used in the project to handle the asynchronous operation of sending a form submission to the server. It is created when the form is submitted and it resolves with a server response. The response is then passed to a callback function for further processing.
          <tr class="lastrow">
          <th class="cell c0" style="" scope="row">Properly explain how a resolve function is used by your project.</th>
          <td class="timeremaining cell c1 lastcol" style="">The resolve function is used to resolve a Promise. It takes a value as an argument and returns a new Promise that resolves with the value. The resolve function is used in the processForm function to resolve the Promise with the server response after the form data has been processed. The resolved Promise is then passed to the parseResponse function for further processing.

          <td class="timeremaining cell c1 lastcol" style="">The resolve value is passed to a callback function when the promise is resolved. For example, in the `getServerResponse2` function, the `resolve` callback is called with a JSON string as the resolve value. This value is then passed to the `parseResponse` function, which extracts and outputs the message contained in the JSON.</td>

          <th class="cell c0" style="" scope="row">Properly explain how setTimeout is used to simulate a server response</th>
          <td class="timeremaining cell c1 lastcol" style="">The setTimeout function is used to simulate a server response by introducing a delay before executing a specified function. In my example, setTimeout is used to delay the resolution of a promise by 5 seconds, mimicking the time it might take for a server to respond. This delay helps in testing the asynchronous behavior of the application by allowing developers to handle the delay in their code logic.</td>

JSON.stringify() is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string. JSON.parse() is used to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object. These methods are used to send and receive data in the form of JSON strings via the fetch API. The JSON.stringify() method is used to convert the data to be sent in the body of the request into a JSON string. The JSON.parse() method is used to convert the server response into a JavaScript object. The JSON methods are used in the project to send and receive data between the client and server.</td>
